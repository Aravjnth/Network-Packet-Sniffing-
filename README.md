# Network Packet Sniffing

## Overview

The Network Packet Sniffing project is a Python-based tool designed to capture and analyze network packets in real-time or from packet capture files. This tool provides capabilities for monitoring network traffic, analyzing protocols, extracting data, and detecting anomalies for network troubleshooting, security monitoring, and protocol analysis purposes.

## Features

- Captures network packets from specified interfaces or packet capture files.
- Supports analysis of various network protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS).
- Extracts packet metadata, payloads, and headers for inspection.
- Performs live packet analysis and monitoring.
- Generates reports and visualizations of network traffic patterns.
- User-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for configuration and operation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `scapy` library for packet sniffing and analysis
- `pcapy` or `pypcap` library for packet capture (optional)
- `matplotlib` library for generating visualizations (optional)
- `numpy` library for numerical operations (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/Aravjnth/Network-Packet-Sniffing-.git
    cd network-packet-sniffing
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start capturing packets from a network interface:
    ```bash
    python sniff_packets.py --interface <network-interface>
    ```

2. Analyze packet capture files:
    ```bash
    python analyze_packets.py --file <packet-capture-file>
    ```

3. Visualize network traffic patterns:
    ```bash
    python visualize_traffic.py --file <packet-capture-file>
    ```

### Example

Capture packets from a specific network interface:
```bash
python sniff_packets.py --interface eth0
```

Analyze a packet capture file:
```bash
python analyze_packets.py --file capture.pcap
```

Visualize network traffic from a packet capture file:
```bash
python visualize_traffic.py --file capture.pcap
```

## Options

- `--interface`: Network interface to capture packets (e.g., eth0, wlan0).
- `--file`: Path to the packet capture file for analysis or visualization.
- Additional configuration options can be customized in `config.py`.
